# Team Profile Generator

## Description

- My motivation to create this project was to better my understanding of node.js and npms. 
- I built this project because I wanted an easier way to view team members and summaries of each person all at once.
- Building this project I learned how to write tests for my code which made it easier to find bugs in my code.


## Installation

To install my project, clone my repo to your local computer. Once cloned you will need to download inquirer and jest. To do so open a terminal from the project folder and run 'npm i inquirer@8.2.4' and then 'npm install --save-dev jest'


## Usage

Once cloned and all npms are downloaded, right click on the main folder and run "npm index.js", this should begin a series of questions. Once you have filled out the info for one team member the cli will ask you if you would like to continue, if you select yes, this will start the program over again and allow you to add another team member to the html page you are creating. Once you have added all team members select no to the final question and a html page will be created and printed to the console. From here you can copy and paste this html right into your own project.
